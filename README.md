🌱 Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas to improve and expand the app:
Search / filter books by title, author, status
Sort books (by date added, title, etc.)
Add book cover images via URLs or uploading
Sync data to a remote backend or cloud database
Add user authentication and multiple user profiles
UI/UX improvements, animations, better styling
Offline-first handling and data sync
Tests: unit tests, integration tests (Jest, React Native Testing Library)
Use TypeScript for stricter type safety
