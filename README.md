# React Native Book Tracking Application

A simple book tracking app built with React Native — it lets users add, view, and manage a collection of books across multiple screens.


## Features

- Manage a collection of books (add, list, delete)
- Four different app screens
- Basic user interface using React Native components
- Persistent data storage (if implemented with local storage / AsyncStorage)
- Clean navigation and flow
## Screens

Here are the main screens in the app:
- Home / Book List – shows the current list of books
- Add Book – form for adding a new book
- Book Details – view details of a selected book
- Edit / Delete Book – modify or remove existing entries
You can add more screens such as filtering, search, or statistics later.
## Tech Stack

- React Native (JavaScript)
- React Navigation (for screen routing)
- AsyncStorage (or any local storage / persistence method)
